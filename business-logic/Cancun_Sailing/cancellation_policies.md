# Cancellation & Weather Policies: Provider + Proprietary Rules

## 1. Proprietary Booking Fee (Non-Refundable)
- **Rule:** A 6% "Booking Fee" is applied to the grand total of every reservation.
- **Condition:** This 6% is strictly NON-REFUNDABLE in all cases, including cancellations by the client or weather-related cancellations.
- **Justification:** This fee covers non-refundable transaction commissions charged by payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal) and administrative costs.

## 2. Client Cancellation Rules (Provider Policy)
- **More than 7 days before the tour:** 100% refund of the deposit (Minus the 6% non-refundable Booking Fee).
- **Within 7 days of the tour:** All deposits are 100% non-refundable.
- **Date Changes:** Flexible date changes are allowed free of charge anytime before the scheduled charter, subject to vessel availability.
- **No-Show:** If the client does not arrive at the marina at the scheduled time, the reservation is considered lost and no refund applies.

## 3. Weather & Safety Policy (The "Port Captain" Rule)
- **Rain or Shine:** Charters operate normally in rain. Tropical weather is unpredictable, and light rain is not a cause for cancellation.
- **Port Closure:** If the "Harbour Master" (Capitanía de Puerto) closes the port to small craft due to unsafe conditions (heavy wind/high waves/hurricanes):
    1. The client may reschedule to any available date at no extra cost.
    2. If rescheduling is impossible, a 100% refund of the "Charter Deposit" will be issued (Minus the 6% non-refundable Booking Fee).
- **Mechanical Failure:** In the rare event of a mechanical issue, Cancun Sailing will attempt to provide a similar or upgraded vessel. If no vessel is available, a full refund of the deposit applies (Minus the 6% Booking Fee).

## 4. Safety Restrictions
- Intoxicated guests or those showing signs of infectious diseases will be denied boarding with no refund.
- All guests must sign a liability waiver before departure.
