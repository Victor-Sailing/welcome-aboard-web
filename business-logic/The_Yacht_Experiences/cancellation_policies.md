# TYE CANCELLATION & RESCHEDULING POLICIES
**Standard:** Professional English | Luxury Hospitality Protocols

## 1. THE "EXPERIENCE" GUARANTEE

* [cite_start]**Price Adjustment:** If a lower-priced vessel is substituted, the price is adjusted; if a higher-priced vessel is provided, no extra charge applies[cite: 21, 22].
* [cite_start]**Itinerary Flex:** Final itineraries are decided on the day of the trip based on weather and safety[cite: 25]. [cite_start]Itinerary changes do not constitute grounds for cancellation[cite: 26].

## 2. WEATHER & PORT CLOSURE LOGIC
* [cite_start]**Expert Determination:** Only TYE determines if weather is unsuitable for navigation[cite: 31, 33]. 
* [cite_start]**Rain/Clouds:** Rain or cloudy forecasts are NOT grounds for cancellation[cite: 28, 44].
